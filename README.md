# ⏳ Days Lived

**A simple Flutter app to reflect on your life — how far you’ve come and how much time remains.**

## 📌 Motivation

The main inspiration for this app was to provide a powerful realization:  
We often overlook how much of our life has already passed, and how precious the remaining time is.  
**Days Lived** was created to help users see their life in terms of days — both lived and left — and use that insight to **make more meaningful choices with their time.**

## 📱 Features

- ✅ Input your birthdate to calculate the number of days you’ve lived.
- 📆 Visualize your life in a grid of days (a life calendar).
- 🕰️ Estimate days remaining based on an average lifespan.
- 💡 Simple yet impactful — designed to make you think.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This app is built using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev). If you're a developer and want to run or contribute to the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK: [Install Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- Dart
- Android Studio / VS Code / Xcode (for iOS)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SuwanSankaja/DaysLived.git
cd DaysLived
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## 🧠 How It Works

You enter your birth date, and the app visualizes:

- Total days lived so far.
- Estimated total lifespan in days.
- A day-by-day view of your life as a grid — showing the days behind you and those that (statistically) lie ahead.
